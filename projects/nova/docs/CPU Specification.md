# Nova-16 CPU Architecture Specification

## Overview
The Nova-16 is a custom 16-bit big-endian Princeton (von Neumann) architecture with a custom ISA. It features a comprehensive instruction set, built-in graphics capabilities, keyboard support, and a robust interrupt system designed for embedded and educational applications.

## Core Architecture

### Data Path and Word Size
- **16-bit architecture** with big-endian byte ordering
- Variable-length instructions (1-4 bytes)
- Support for both 8-bit and 16-bit data operations
- Princeton architecture (unified memory space for code and data)

### Register Set

#### General-Purpose Registers
- **R0-R9**: Ten 8-bit general-purpose registers (0x00-0xFF)
- **P0-P9**: Ten 16-bit general-purpose registers (0x0000-0xFFFF)
- **VX, VY**: Two 8-bit graphics registers for coordinate operations

#### Special Registers
- **PC (Program Counter)**: 16-bit register pointing to the next instruction
- **SP (Stack Pointer)**: 16-bit register (P8) pointing to top of stack in memory, initialized to 0xFFFF
- **FP (Frame Pointer)**: 16-bit register (P9) for function frame management, initialized to 0xFFFF
- **TT, TM, TC, TS**: Timer control registers
- **SA, SF, SV, SW**: Sound registers
- **VM**: Video mode register
- **VL**: Graphics layer register

#### Register Access Modes
- **Direct access**: R0-R9, P0-P9, VX, VY
- **High-byte access**: P0: through P9: (bits 15-8 of P registers)
- **Low-byte access**: :P0 through :P9 (bits 7-0 of P registers)
- **Indirect access**: [R0] through [R9], [P0] through [P9]
- **Indexed access**: [R0+offset] through [R9+offset], [P0+offset] through [P9+offset]

### Status Flags Register
The CPU maintains a 12-bit flags register with the following flags:

| Bit | Flag | Name | Description |
|-----|------|------|-------------|
| 11 | E | Hacker | User-defined flag (not modified by CPU) |
| 10 | A | BCD Carry | Set if BCD operation result > 9 |
| 9 | H | Direction | Set for high-to-low execution mode | unimplemented
| 8 | P | Parity | Set if result has even number of 1-bits |
| 7 | Z | Zero | Set if operation result is zero |
| 6 | C | Carry | Set if operation produces carry/borrow |
| 5 | I | Interrupt | Set if interrupts are enabled |
| 4 | D | Decimal | Set if BCD arithmetic mode is enabled |
| 3 | B | Break | Set if breakpoint is encountered |
| 2 | O | Overflow | Set if signed arithmetic overflow occurs |
| 1 | S | Sign | Set if result is negative (MSB = 1) |
| 0 | T | Trap | Set to enable single-step mode |

### Flag Behavior in Arithmetic Operations

The CPU flags are updated by arithmetic and comparison operations according to standard x86-like behavior:

#### Zero Flag (Z)
- Set when the result of an operation is zero
- Used by JZ/JNZ instructions for equality testing

#### Sign Flag (S) 
- Set when the result has the most significant bit set (negative in signed interpretation)
- Used by JS/JNS instructions for signed value testing

#### Carry Flag (C)
- For addition: Set when unsigned overflow occurs (result < either operand)
- For subtraction/CMP: Set when borrow occurs (op1 < op2 in unsigned comparison)
- Used by JC/JNC instructions for unsigned overflow detection

#### Overflow Flag (O)
- Set when signed arithmetic overflow occurs
- For addition: (pos + pos = neg) or (neg + neg = pos)
- For subtraction: (pos - neg = neg) or (neg - pos = pos)
- Used by JO/JNO instructions and critical for signed comparisons

#### Parity Flag (P)
- Set when the low 8 bits of the result have an even number of 1 bits
- Used by JP/JNP instructions

### Conditional Jump Instructions

The Nova-16 provides conditional jump instructions that test various flag combinations:

| Instruction | Syntax | Condition | Description |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| JZ | `JZ addr` | Z = 1 | Jump if zero (equal) |
| JNZ | `JNZ addr` | Z = 0 | Jump if not zero (not equal) |
| JS | `JS addr` | S = 1 | Jump if sign (negative) |
| JNS | `JNS addr` | S = 0 | Jump if no sign (positive/zero) |
| JC | `JC addr` | C = 1 | Jump if carry (unsigned overflow/borrow) |
| JNC | `JNC addr` | C = 0 | Jump if no carry |
| JO | `JO addr` | O = 1 | Jump if overflow (signed overflow) |
| JNO | `JNO addr` | O = 0 | Jump if no overflow |
| JLT | `JLT addr` | O ⊕ S = 1 | Jump if less than (signed comparison) |
| JGE | `JGE addr` | O ⊕ S = 0 | Jump if greater or equal (signed) |
| JGT | `JGT addr` | Z = 0 ∧ (O ⊕ S) = 0 | Jump if greater than (signed) |
| JLE | `JLE addr` | Z = 1 ∨ (O ⊕ S) = 1 | Jump if less or equal (signed) |

#### Signed Comparison Logic
The signed comparison instructions (JLT, JGE, JGT, JLE) use the overflow and sign flags together:
- **JLT (Jump if Less Than)**: Jumps when O ⊕ S = 1
- **JGE (Jump if Greater or Equal)**: Jumps when O ⊕ S = 0

This implements the standard signed comparison logic where:
- Less than occurs when overflow and sign differ
- Greater than or equal occurs when overflow and sign are the same

#### Comparison Examples
```asm
; Signed comparison: if (a < b) goto less
CMP a, b
JLT less

; Unsigned comparison: if (a < b) goto less  
CMP a, b
JC less

; Equality test: if (a == b) goto equal
CMP a, b
JZ equal

; Signed greater than: if (a > b) goto greater
CMP a, b
JGT greater
```

### Memory Architecture
- **64KB unified address space** (0x0000 - 0xFFFF)
- **Memory-mapped I/O** for peripheral access
- **Interrupt vector table** at 0x0100-0x011F (8 vectors × 4 bytes each)
- **Hardware stack**: Memory-based stack using SP register, grows downward from 0xFFFF
- **Big-endian byte ordering**: MSB stored at lower address
- **Bank-switched memory window** at 0x8000-0xBFFF (16KB): the `BANK` register
  (0-15, default 0) selects which physical page is visible in this window.
  Bank 0 is the base 64KB memory itself (pass-through — reading/writing the
  window while `BANK=0` is byte-identical to a system with no banking at
  all). Banks 1-15 are separate 16KB pages of additional RAM, giving ~304KB
  of total physical capacity while the CPU remains a 16-bit-address,
  64KB-at-once machine. Addresses outside 0x8000-0xBFFF always target base
  memory regardless of the current bank. Switch banks with plain register
  access — `MOV BANK, imm8` or `MOV BANK, R0` — like `SA`/`VM`/`TT` and the
  other external registers; there is no dedicated bank-select instruction.

### Stack Implementation
- **Stack Pointer (SP)**: P8 register points to the top of the stack
- **Frame Pointer (FP)**: P9 register used for function frame management
- **Stack Direction**: Grows downward (SP decreases on push operations)
- **Initial SP Value**: 0xFFFF (top of memory)
- **Data Storage**: All stack entries stored as 16-bit values
- **Stack Operations**: PUSH/POP instructions automatically manage SP
- **Function Calls**: CALL instruction pushes return address, RET pops it
- **Interrupts**: Automatic context saving (PC + flags) to stack

### Interrupt System

#### Interrupt Vectors and Priorities
The Nova-16 supports 8 interrupt levels with hardware prioritization:

| Vector | Address | Priority | Type | Description |
|--------|---------|----------|------|-------------|
| 0 | 0x0100 | Highest | Timer | Timer/counter overflow |
| 1 | 0x0104 | High | Serial | Serial I/O completion |
| 2 | 0x0108 | Medium | Keyboard | Keyboard input available |
| 3 | 0x010C | Medium | Mouse | Mouse interrupt available |
| 4 | 0x0110 | Low | User 1 | User-defined interrupt 1 |
| 5 | 0x0114 | Lower | Reserved | Future expansion |
| 6 | 0x0118 | Lower | Reserved | Future expansion |
| 7 | 0x011C | lowest | Debug | Used for hardware breakpoints and trap mode |

#### Interrupt Handling
- **Automatic context saving**: PC and flags pushed to stack
- **Interrupt disable**: I flag cleared during interrupt processing
- **Vectored interrupts**: Jump to handler address from vector table
- **IRET instruction**: Restores context and re-enables interrupts
- **Software interrupts**: INT instruction for system calls

#### Peripheral Interrupt Sources

**Timer Interrupt (Vector 0)**
- 4-byte control structure: Counter, Modulo, Control, Speed
- Programmable timer with overflow interrupt capability

**Serial Interrupt (Vector 1)**
- Implemented and features a UART component - update this section with more detail.

**Keyboard Interrupt (Vector 2)**
- 4-byte control structure: Data, Status, Control, Buffer count
- 16-key circular buffer with overflow protection
- Status flags: Key available, Buffer full, Interrupt pending

## Instruction Set Architecture

### Instruction Format and Encoding
- **Prefixed operand instructions**: All instructions use a consistent format
- **Opcode**: 1 byte (defines core operation)
- **Mode byte**: 1 byte (defines operand addressing modes)
- **Operands**: Variable length based on mode byte (0-6 bytes)
- **Big-endian encoding**: Multi-byte values stored MSB first

#### New Instruction Format
```
Instruction: [Opcode] [Mode Byte] [Operand Data...]

Mode Byte Format:
Bits 0-1: Operand 1 addressing mode
Bits 2-3: Operand 2 addressing mode  
Bits 4-5: Operand 3 addressing mode
Bit 6: Indexed addressing flag
Bit 7: Direct addressing flag

Addressing Modes:
00: Register direct
01: Immediate 8-bit
10: Immediate 16-bit
11: Memory reference (direct/indirect/indexed)
```

#### Example Instructions
```
MOV R0, 0x1234
06 08 A9 12 34
 |  |  |  |  |
 |  |  |  |  +- 0x34 (low byte of 0x1234)
 |  |  |  +---- 0x12 (high byte of 0x1234)  
 |  |  +------- 0xA9 (R0 register encoding)
 |  +---------- 0x08 (mode: op1=reg, op2=imm16)
 +------------- 0x06 (MOV opcode)

PUSH P0
2E 00 B3
 |  |  |
 |  |  +- 0xB3 (P0 register encoding)
 |  +---- 0x00 (mode: op1=reg)
 +------- 0x2E (PUSH opcode)
```

#### Memory Addressing Encodings
| Addressing Mode | Encoding Format | Example |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Direct | [0xHHHH] | [0x1000] = 0x10 0x00 |
| Register Indirect | [reg] | [P0] = 0xB3 |
| Register Indexed | [reg+offset] | [P0+4] = 0xB3 0x04 |


## Instruction Set Reference

The Nova-16 provides comprehensive stack support through dedicated hardware registers and memory-based operations:

| Instruction | Syntax | Description | Operation |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| PUSH | `PUSH reg` | Push register onto stack | SP -= 2; memory[SP] = reg |
| POP | `POP reg` | Pop value from stack to register | reg = memory[SP]; SP += 2 |
| PUSHA | `PUSHA` | Push all registers onto stack | Push R0-R9, P0-P9, flags |
| POPA | `POPA` | Pop all registers from stack | Pop flags, P9-P0, R9-R0 |
| PUSHF | `PUSHF` | Push flags register onto stack | SP -= 2; memory[SP] = flags |
| POPF | `POPF` | Pop flags register from stack | flags = memory[SP]; SP += 2 |
| CALL | `CALL addr` | Call subroutine | SP -= 2; memory[SP] = PC; PC = addr |
| RET | `RET` | Return from subroutine | PC = memory[SP]; SP += 2 |
| INT | `INT vector` | Software interrupt | SP -= 2; memory[SP] = PC; SP -= 2; memory[SP] = flags; PC = vector_table[vector] |
| IRET | `IRET` | Return from interrupt | flags = memory[SP]; SP += 2; PC = memory[SP]; SP += 2 |

### Stack Usage Examples

**Function Call Convention:**
```asm
; Function call
CALL my_function

; Function implementation
my_function:
    PUSH FP        ; Save old frame pointer
    MOV FP, SP     ; Set new frame pointer
    ; Function body...
    MOV SP, FP     ; Restore stack pointer
    POP FP         ; Restore frame pointer
    RET            ; Return to caller
```

**Interrupt Handler:**
```asm
; Timer interrupt handler at 0x0100
    PUSH R0        ; Save working registers
    ; Handle timer...
    POP R0         ; Restore registers
    IRET           ; Return from interrupt
```
